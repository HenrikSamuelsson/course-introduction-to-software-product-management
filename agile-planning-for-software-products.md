# Agile Planning for Software Products

Notes on the the course Agile Planning for Software Products.

This course covers the techniques required to break down and map requirements into plans to drive software production.

Upon successful completion of this course, you will be able to:

- Create effective plans for software development
- Map user requirements to developer tasks
- Assess and plan for project risks
- Apply velocity-driven planning techniques
- Generate work estimates for software products

## Module 1 Introduction to Planning

### Introduction to Planning

Recall of some terms introduced in other courses in this specialization:

| Term | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| milestone | Checkpoint to be passed in a project, measures progress |
| role | Function that a person involved in a project takes on |
| schedule | A timeline holding tasks for a  project |
| task | Small, manageable work item part of a  project |
| work product | Intermediate product produced by a task in a project|

### Uncertainty Space

There are basically two types of uncertainties in a project:

- What is to be created, also known as the ends
- How will it be created, also known as the means

There will a high degree of uncertainty at the beginning of the project and the uncertainty will shrink as the project is completed.

The two types of uncertainty can be graphed in a two dimensional chart with "what" in the vertical  direction and "how" in the horizontal direction. These types of graphs are called the uncertainty space.

The uncertainty space graphs will look different depending on how the project is executed. In water fall so will the "what" part increase early because there is a lot of up front planning. On the other side if having an ad-hoc approach so will the "how" part be dominant at the start of the project since in this type of project you will just start implementing without much planning.

### Work Breakdown Structure

A work break down structure is a hierarchical structure in which a project as a whole is split into smaller manageable parts. The hierarchy of the work break down structure can be viewed visually be creating a tree view of the project. For example by the large parts on the top and then letting each part branch out to show more details in the bottom.

Benefits of doing a work break down structure is:

- Simplifies estimates becaus a small step is easier to estimates
- Enables parallel development work because of the split of the project into chunks
- Enables tracking of progress and resource planning

## Module 2 Project Planning

### Story Points

A story point is a unit of measurement for estimating the effort needed to complete a task. A simple task will typically be assigned one story point and more complex tasks will be assigned more points.

Story points are purposely a vague measurement of time. This relates well with that estimations of how long a SW task will take is only a educated guess. Estimating tasks in story points instead of time takes away a bit of pressure on the developers because when estimating in time this can be taken as a commitment by the managers. Story points makes it more clear that there is in reality no way to be exactly sure when things are done but there is at least a rough idea that can be used for planning future work.

### Velocity Estimates

Velocity is a number of story points completed per sprint. Measuring velocity enables estimation for how much work that can be included in the next sprint and when the project as a whole will be completed.

Measuring velocity is done in the following way:

1. Assign story points to tasks
2. Put a number of tasks into the sprint during sprint planning
3. Start the sprint and work on the tasks
4. End the sprint and check what task where completed
5. Sum of the story points of completed is the velocity

Velocity is easier to estimate in the middle of the project when a few sprint have been completed due to having more historical data collected about he velocity.

Velocity measurements are only valid if the environment is stable. Factors such as replacing team members, changing the process, and changes to how the team sits will affect the velocity.

Velocity will generally more stable after a couple of sprints if the environment does not change and the work is done at a sustainable pace to avoid the team getting burned out.

As with all statistics it is easy to cheat and interpret the data in different ways, this holds for measuring velocity. It is important to have a clear definition of done for a story to know the real velocity. This can be that the product owner accept the user story as done.

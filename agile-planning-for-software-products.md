# Agile Planning for Software Products

Notes on the the course Agile Planning for Software Products.

This course covers the techniques required to break down and map requirements into plans to drive software production.

Upon successful completion of this course, you will be able to:

- Create effective plans for software development
- Map user requirements to developer tasks
- Assess and plan for project risks
- Apply velocity-driven planning techniques
- Generate work estimates for software products

## Module 1 Introduction to Planning

### Introduction to Planning

Recall of some terms introduced in other courses in this specialization:

| Term | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| milestone | Checkpoint to be passed in a project, measures progress |
| role | Function that a person involved in a project takes on |
| schedule | A timeline holding tasks for a  project |
| task | Small, manageable work item part of a  project |
| work product | Intermediate product produced by a task in a project|

### Uncertainty Space

There are basically two types of uncertainties in a project:

- What is to be created, also known as the ends
- How will it be created, also known as the means

There will a high degree of uncertainty at the beginning of the project and the uncertainty will shrink as the project is completed.

The two types of uncertainty can be graphed in a two dimensional chart with "what" in the vertical  direction and "how" in the horizontal direction. These types of graphs are called the uncertainty space.

The uncertainty space graphs will look different depending on how the project is executed. In water fall so will the "what" part increase early because there is a lot of up front planning. On the other side if having an ad-hoc approach so will the "how" part be dominant at the start of the project since in this type of project you will just start implementing without much planning.

Requirements are an integral part of agile. Requirements will often change as more facets of the products are discovered during product development. Agile methodologies support changes to requirements
by integrating the customer and working iteratively with feedback built in to the process.

### User Stories

User stories express requirements in a consistent format intended to make them easy to write and understand:

> As a **who**  
> I want to **what**  
> So that **why**

Who is a type of use, what is a goal, and why is a reason.

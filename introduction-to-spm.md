### 1.2.1 Project Success, Why Agile

There is not a single definition of project success. One definition that sometimes is used is:

> On time, on budget, and to specification

When asking IT-professionals in a survey about the above definition so would the majority value being on time higher than the other two factors from above.

Agile practices are guidelines on how software development should be done in the best way.

### Agile Manifesto

### Why Process?

### Why Requirements?

A requirement describes a need that a product shall full fill. A requirement shall only describe a single need, a product will hence most often have a set of requirements. Requirements shall be documented to avoid confusion about what needs to be done.

### Why Planning?

### Why Monitoring?

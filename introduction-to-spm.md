### 1.2.1 Project Success, Why Agile

There is not a single definition of project success. One definition that sometimes is used is:

> On time, on budget, and to specification

When asking IT-professionals in a survey about the above definition so would the majority value being on time higher than the other two factors from above.

Agile practices are guidelines on how software development should be done in the best way.

### Agile Manifesto

The four core values of the Manifesto for Agile Software Development are stated as:

> Individuals and interactions over processes and tools  
> Working software over comprehensive documentation  
> Customer collaboration over contract negotiation  
> Responding to change over following a plan  

### Why Process?

### Why Requirements?

A requirement describes a need that a product shall full fill. A requirement shall only describe a single need, a product will hence most often have a set of requirements. Requirements shall be documented to avoid confusion about what needs to be done.

### Why Planning?

The author Alan Lakein calls planning

> Planning is bringing the future into the present so you can do something about it now.

Wikipedia defines planning as

> Planning is the process of thinking regarding the activities required to achieve a desired goal, planning is anticipating monitoring and review.

Planning gives an estimate an a early stage about the feasibility of a project. Proper planning reduces risk of failure when reserve plans are developed during the planning process. Planning provides a guide for action. Planning improves resource utilization. Plans provides motivation and commitment by enabling people to understand what is expected of them and believe that the goals are feasible.

### Why Monitoring?

# Software Processes and Agile Practices

Notes on the course Software Processes and Agile Practices.

## Introduction to Processes

### Processes and Practices

Having a process to follow brings order to the software development aiding in not to miss out on necessary work to be done.

A process enables splitting the work into smaller parts that can be understood and handled by individual teams or single team members.

Some terms and definitions related to processes:

| Term         | Definition                                            |
| ---          | ---                                                   |
| lifecycle    | Life span of a product, from conception to retirement |
| activity     | A set of related tasks                                |
| task         | Small manageable work unit                            |
| dependency   | Relationship that specifies ordering of work units    |
| work product | Produced output upon completing a task                |
| resource     | Something that improves, advances, or funds a task    |
| role         | A job-related activity that a person takes on         |

A role performs a task and the result is that a work product is produced, resources are consumed while executing the task.

Some examples involving the above terms when developing a software product:

It is the role of the architect to perform the task of producing the high level design, and the work product will be a document with text and diagrams describing the design.

The design will then need to be reviewed by other roles such as developers and product owners, this review task produces as work product in the form of a review document.

The design task and the review task are part of the same activity.

There is a dependency between the design and the review since the design must be done before the review can be performed.

During the lifecycle of the product there might be need for adaptions. The design document can then be studied again to find out how it is suitable to adapt to support the new needs.

### Software Engineering Activities

IEEE 1074 is a standard providing a process for creating a software project life cycle process. This standard is however not free and costs more than the entire course to buy. Activities are presented in the course and I presume that these activities are derived from the standard.

There are generally four main software engineering activities:

- Project management
- Specification
- Design and implementation
- Verification and validation

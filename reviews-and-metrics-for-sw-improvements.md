# Reviews and Metrics for Software Improvements

Notes on the course Reviews and Metrics for Software Improvements.This course covers techniques for monitoring projects in order to align client needs, project plans, and software development. It discusses metrics and reviews to track and improve progress and quality.

## Right Product

This first module in the course focuses on ensuring that the right product is being delivered. A product that covers the users needs in an effective way.

Reminder on terms the terms verification and validation. Verification means ensuring that the product works as intended according to the requirements. Validation on the other hand refers to that the product shall meet the needs of the stakeholders. Stakeholders are both the client and the end-users.

### Introduction to Monitoring

### Sprint Review Meeting

### User Studies

### Industry Examples

## Done Right

### Review Techniques

#### Code Reviews

Code reviews are methodical assessments of code designed to identify bugs, increase code quality, and help developers learn the source code. The course divides code reviews into three different categories:

- Software walkthroughs
- Software technical reviews
- Software inspections

The first type is the least formal and will not produce any output documents. The second is more formal and the third is the most formal. The most formal software inspection will include a multi stage process, something like the following:

- Planning stage
- Overview meeting
- Preparation stage
- Inspection meeting
- Rework
- Follow-up

### Monitoring Issues

It is argued in the course that main issue that metrics are not used in monitoring is lack of knowledge among developers and managers.

Some metrics might actually be worse to use than using no metrics at all, a classic example here is to use the metrics lines of code. The developers will simply adapt by writing their code in a way that it they write more lines without added functionality or quality.

Another misuse of metrics i to try quantifying everything and not aim to have metrics on what really matters.

One scenario with an issue is to have requirements on documenting things in Word documents that can easily be autogenerated with scripts from the project version control system if needed. This will just make the documents longer and more cumbersome to read and review.

### Goal Quality Metric (GQM)

Goal Quality Metric (GQM) is a framework used for for improving software quality and other aspects of software development.

A goal is setup for what is to be achieved then a set of questions is used to define a model of the object to be improved, finally metrics are established based on the model that shall answer the questions in a measurable way.

Example of the QGM process:

- Purpose: Evaluate
- Object: Test Framework
- Viewpoint: From the test builders point of view
- Issue: The learning time and effectiveness of

Question: Is the framework documented properly to be able to learn it

Metric: Readability of help documentation
Metric: Availability of tutorials
Metric: Availability of external courses

### Desirable Properties of Metrics

There are three terms that need to be known when discussing metrics

- measure
- metric
- indicator

A measure is a standardized unit for measurement. For example meter, bug, or story point. It is important the measure is consistent to be able to measure metrics.

A metric is a combination of two or more measures combined in a meaningful way. For example meter per second, or story points per sprint.

An indicator is a measure that gives useful information. A cars velocity being a bit below the regulated speed limit is an example of an indicator that gives information that the speed is considered safe and the driver will not be fined by the traffic police.

### Other Metrics

### Defect Analysis

## Managed Right

## Project Retrospective

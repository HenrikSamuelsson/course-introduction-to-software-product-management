# Reviews and Metrics for Software Improvements

Notes on the course Reviews and Metrics for Software Improvements.This course covers techniques for monitoring projects in order to align client needs, project plans, and software development. It discusses metrics and reviews to track and improve progress and quality.

## Right Product

This first module in the course focuses on ensuring that the right product is being delivered. A product that covers the users needs in an effective way.

Reminder on terms the terms verification and validation. Verification means ensuring that the product works as intended according to the requirements. Validation on the other hand refers to that the product shall meet the needs of the stakeholders. Stakeholders are both the client and the end-users.

### Introduction to Monitoring

### Sprint Review Meeting

### Review Techniques

#### Code Reviews

Code reviews are methodical assessments of code designed to identify bugs, increase code quality, and help developers learn the source code. The course divides code reviews into three different categories:

- Software walkthroughs
- Software technical reviews
- Software inspections

The first type is the least formal and will not produce any output documents. The second is more formal and the third is the most formal. The most formal software inspection will include a multi stage process, something like the following:

- Planning stage
- Overview meeting
- Preparation stage
- Inspection meeting
- Rework
- Follow-up

### Monitoring Issues

It is argued in the course that main issue that metrics are not used in monitoring is lack of knowledge among developers and managers.

Some metrics might actually be worse to use than using no metrics at all, a classic example here is to use the metrics lines of code. The developers will simply adapt by writing their code in a way that it they write more lines without added functionality or quality.

Another misuse of metrics i to try quantifying everything and not aim to have metrics on what really matters.

One scenario with an issue is to have requirements on documenting things in Word documents that can easily be autogenerated with scripts from the project version control system if needed. This will just make the documents longer and more cumbersome to read and review.
